# CONCLUSIONS
* Using Cardboard instead of foam sheet we can reduce embodied energy by 64.7% .
* Using foam instead of acrylic sheet we can reduce embodied energy by 27.35% .
* Using L clamps instead of Aluminium clamps we can reduce embodied energy by 23.5% .
* Using Acrylics nuts  instead of Nuts and bolts we can reduce embodied energy by 28.87% .
