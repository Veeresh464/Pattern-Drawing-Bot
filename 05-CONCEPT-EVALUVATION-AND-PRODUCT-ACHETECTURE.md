## 5.1 JUSTIFICATION FOR SCORE GIVEN
### LINKAGE MECHANISM is being used as the datum.
  |DESIGNS| SAFETY | 
  |---------|--------|
  |X Y PLOTTER|6|
  |TURTLE|0|
  |ROBOTIC ARM|-12|
* X Y PLOTTER : This gets the max safety score because of the absence of the saperate high speed rotatables.
* TURTLE : This get the equal safety as that of the linkage mechanism because of the prone to the damage.
* ROBOTIC ARM : This gets the minimum safety because of its functioning of the pattern method.
  |DESIGNS| MAINTAINANCE | 
  |---------|--------|
  |X Y PLOTTER|-14|
  |TURTLE|0|-14|
  |ROBOTIC ARM|-14|
   * In maintainance  all of them got the minimum because 
        1. Much sensetive design of models.
        2. More prone to the damages.
        3. Difficulty in the repair process of the machine.

  |DESIGN|PORTABLE|
  |------|--------|
  |X Y PLOTTER|-5|
  |TURTLE|+5|
  |ROBOTIC ARM|+5|
  
* X Y PLOTTER : Portability of the x y plotter is the difficult as according to the blue print of the model submitted. 
* TURTLE : Portability of this design is better than that of the datum because of its compact designing.
* ROBOTIC ARM : Its portability is as same as that of linkage because of the height adjustable system given in the model designing.
|DESIGNS| LIGHT WEIGHT | 
  |---------|--------|
  |X Y PLOTTER|-3|
  |TURTLE|3|
  |ROBOTIC ARM|-6|
* TURTLE gets the lead of the compact design.
* X Y PLOTTER  was in the negative because of its width it the model.
* ROBOTIC ARM strength was increased by the double handling system for its efficient management.
|DESIGNS| STABILITY  | 
  |---------|--------|
  |X Y PLOTTER|9|
  |TURTLE|0|-18|
  |ROBOTIC ARM|-18|
*  X Y PLOTTER gets the most stability because of its area of the occupation of its base for the process of the pattern drawing.
* TURTLE AND ROBOTIC ARM gets equal in the minimum value because of the design, weight distribution and the arm instability problem respectively.
